- **Column-Specific Filtering**: Target specific attributes for more precise data exploration
- **Pagination Controls**: Navigate through large datasets efficiently with configurable page sizes

### 4. Intelligent Interface Elements
- **Context-Aware Loading States**: Skeleton screens provide visual continuity during data loading
- **Responsive Header Controls**: Date range selector adapts to available screen space
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Proper contrast ratios and semantic HTML structure

## Technical Implementation Details

### React Component Architecture
The application follows a modular component structure:
```
├── components/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   ├── MetricCard.jsx       # Individual metric display
│   │   ├── RevenueChart.jsx     # Revenue distribution visualization
│   │   ├── TopSongsChart.jsx    # Song popularity visualization
│   │   ├── UserGrowthChart.jsx  # User metrics over time
│   │   ├── StreamsTable.jsx     # Data table component
│   │   └── DateRangeSelector.jsx # Time period selection
│   └── layout/
│       ├── Layout.jsx           # Main layout wrapper
│       ├── Header.jsx           # Application header
│       └── Sidebar.jsx          # Navigation sidebar
├── context/
│   ├── DashboardContext.jsx     # Dashboard data state management
│   └── ThemeContext.jsx         # Theme preference management
└── pages/
    └── Dashboard.jsx            # Main dashboard composition
```

### State Management Strategy
Streamify implements a thoughtful state management approach:

1. **Context Providers**: 
   - `ThemeProvider` maintains user interface preferences
   - `DashboardProvider` handles data fetching, filtering, and cross-component interactions

2. **State Optimization**:
   - Localized state for component-specific concerns
   - Shared state for cross-component communication
   - Memoization of derived data to prevent recalculation

### Performance Optimizations

#### Code Splitting
```jsx
// Lazy loading implementation
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));

// Used with suspense for better UX
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
  </Routes>
</Suspense>
```

#### Component Memoization
```jsx
// Prevent unnecessary re-renders
const MetricCardGrid = React.memo(({ metrics, darkMode }) => (
  // Component implementation
));

// Optimized cell renderers
const TrendCell = React.memo(({ getValue, darkMode }) => {
  // Cell implementation
});
```

#### Hook Optimization
```jsx
// Memoized calculations
const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
  // Complex data processing
}, [dependencies]);

// Stable callback references
const handleMouseMove = useCallback((data) => {
  // Event handling logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

## Tailwind CSS Implementation

Streamify leverages Tailwind CSS with a customized configuration to create a consistent, responsive, and visually appealing interface:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  // Configuration details
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // Custom color system
        primary: { /* color scale */ },
        secondary: { /* color scale */ },
        // Theme-specific colors
        background: {
          dark: '#0F1116',
          light: '#FFFFFF'
        },
        // UI surface treatments
        surface: { /* variants */ },
        text: { /* variants */ }
      },
      // Custom animations and effects
      animation: { /* custom animations */ },
      // Other extensions
    }
  }
}
```

This approach ensures:
1. Consistent design language across components
2. Easy theme switching between dark and light modes
3. Responsive behavior without additional media queries
4. Performance benefits from utility-first CSS

## Deployment and CI/CD

The application is configured for easy deployment with Vite:

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
